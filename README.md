## Summary

This document provides the R code and accompanying explanations to reproduce Figures 2A-D, 3B-C,F, 4A-D, 5C from the manuscript with working title "Pervasive changes of mRNA splicing in upf1 deficient zebrafish identify rpl10a as a regulator of T cell development"" by Lawir et al..
The analysis starts with sleuth (differential transcript expression) and salmon (transcript quantitation), as well as rMATS (differential splicing) output tables and walks the reader through the computational procedures underlying the manuscript figures.  A copy of this document will be deposited on GitHub under https://github.com/katsikora/Lawir2019_SupplementaryCodeAndData upon publication. The code is formatted in a way to facilitate understanding and interpretation by a lay R user.
This code is authored by Katarzyna Sikora.

Raw sequencing data has been submitted to GEO and is available under the ID GSE136669.
Processed data files used in the R vignette contained in this repo are stored on the German GWDG cloud due to file size restrictions on GitHub.
The Rmd document provides download links to the processed data files.
